As of 06/05/2022 (uk date) V1 of the Discord Catfish Finder is discontinued. For future support and access to other social media scrapers, please use socialscraper.co.uk. Currently, the website is buggy, but it is improving by the day :). I hope to see you there.

The Discord Catfish Finder, enter a users id and it will automatically reverse image search their profile picture. This can be used for people with irl photos, and with people using art for their profile pictures. Note: Yandex returning no matches/clear results for names/places/art means that there is a high chance that the user is legit, but not 100%. Due to gui issues the project will revert back to a cli format

## Install on windows - latest v1.6

Either:
* Dowload the zip file (not source code) from the releases tab. Unzip the folder and run the runme.exe
* Gitclone the repo and run main.py - a batch file will automatically install the dependencies (you will need python and pip installed for this)

## Install on linux - latest v1.1

### Download Files

Download DCF.linux.V1.1.7z from releases tab

### Run bash file (installing dependencies)

### Run python file
